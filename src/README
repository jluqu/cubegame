Hey! You found my project, which at the moment is a baby project, but provided I don't get bored and drop it, will grow into a more mature game.

What it is:
Right now, its just a physics simulation that shoots a bunch of cubes around a 2D-ish 3D space, with invisible barriers on either side so they don't fall out.

Where its going:
Eventually I hope to make it into a platform game with some cool physics/puzzle solving elements. I'm still working on more ideas and contemplating the underlying framework to make them happen.

Dependencies:
 - JBullet physics engine
 - LWJGL (light weight java game library)
 - Java 3D API (for Vector3f)

It won't be called "cubegame" forever. Once I actually think of a name, I'll change it.
